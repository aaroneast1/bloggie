**Trying out Node.js with express, rethinkdb, mocha and grunt**


I wrote this project to try and get my head around using express, rethinkdb and testing with mocha.

To run the tests simply execute *grunt* in the root of the project.  I have not included the libraries so you will need to download them using npm.
